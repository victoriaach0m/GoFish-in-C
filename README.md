# Go Fish Game in C

This is a terminal-based Go Fish card game written in C, using linked lists for card management. The game includes deck creation, shuffling, dealing, book counting, and middle pile management.

## Features

- Deck creation using a standard 52-card deck
- Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm
- Dealing cards to players
- Middle pile for drawing cards
- Book counting (collecting sets of 4 cards of the same rank)
- Linked list-based card management

## How It Works

- The deck is shuffled using Fisher-Yates.
- Each player is dealt 7 cards from the deck.
- Players take turns asking for cards.
- If a player gets 4 of a kind, it's counted as a "book".
- The game continues until the deck and player hands are empty.
